# orientorm
OrientORM is a ORM (currently ODM) for [OrientDB](https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb).
It uses [oriento](https://github.com/codemix/oriento) package as a main driver.

OrientORM is based on [Mongoose](https://github.com/learnboost/mongoose) (Schemas/Models/Documents) with some ideas from Yii and Laravel codebase.

Some usage examples will be added later, but the usage is very similar to Mongoose.
